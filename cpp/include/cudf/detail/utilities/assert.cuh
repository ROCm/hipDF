/**
 * @brief Macro indicating that a location in the code is unreachable.
 *
 * The CUDF_UNREACHABLE macro should only be used where CUDF_FAIL cannot be used
 * due to performance or due to being used in device code. In the majority of
 * host code situations, an exception should be thrown in "unreachable" code
 * paths as those usually aren't tight inner loops like they are in device code.
 *
 * One example where this macro may be used is in conjunction with dispatchers
 * to indicate that a function does not need to return a default value because
 * it has already exhausted all possible cases in a `switch` statement.
 *
 * The assert in this macro can be used when compiling in debug mode to help
 * debug functions that may reach the supposedly unreachable code.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * CUDF_UNREACHABLE("Invalid type_id.");
 * ```
